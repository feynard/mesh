To think about (have to):
    * Rewrite everything with 4 by 4 matrices

    * Local transformation controls, move, scale, rotate

    * Child class of Mesh with "hardcoded" simple geometry. I still don't
    understand what does it mean?

    * I think there should be done some work concerned with how .hpp files are
    included, for now there is some mess. For example, graphic_support.hpp
    compiles because of shader_init.cpp, which is not so good: it's impossible
    to add something new to it with generic types, vectors and matrices.

To add:

    * Adding new colour themes feature would be great. For example, define a
    structure ColorScheme, which holds six colors, that can be used as
    background, font, edges/faces, vertex normals, face normals colours,
    respectively, of course. Then it can be passed to Mesh container and used
    several times in main drawing loop for background and text colours.
